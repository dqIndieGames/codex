# Configuration

For basic configuration instructions, see [this documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-basic).

## Commit attribution

Codex can add a [git trailer](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers) to
generated commit messages so commits make Codex's involvement explicit. This
behavior is gated by the `codex_git_commit` feature flag; the top-level
`commit_attribution` setting is only used when that feature is enabled.

Add the following to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
commit_attribution = "Codex <noreply@openai.com>"

[features]
codex_git_commit = true
```

When enabled, Codex appends a `Co-authored-by:` trailer using the configured
attribution value. If `commit_attribution` is omitted, Codex uses
`Codex <noreply@openai.com>`. Set `commit_attribution = ""` to disable the
trailer while leaving the feature flag enabled.

## OpenTelemetry Trace Metadata

Codex can add static OpenTelemetry span attributes to exported trace spans and
static W3C tracestate fields to propagated trace context:

```toml
[otel.span_attributes]
"example.trace_attr" = "enabled"

[otel.tracestate.example]
alpha = "one"
beta = "two"
```

Nested `otel.tracestate` tables are encoded as semicolon-separated `key:value`
fields inside the named tracestate member. If propagated trace context already
has the named member, Codex upserts configured fields and preserves other fields
in that member. This config shape does not support setting opaque tracestate
member values. Invalid trace metadata entries are ignored during config load and
reported as startup warnings.

## SQLite State DB

Codex stores the SQLite-backed state DB under `sqlite_home` (config key) or the
`CODEX_SQLITE_HOME` environment variable. When unset, WorkspaceWrite sandbox
sessions default to a temp directory; other modes default to `CODEX_HOME`.

## Runtime Load Switches

The local2 runtime-load switches default to off. Users do not see new UI for
these switches; the visible effect is that Codex runs with less background
analytics, feedback capture, and SQLite log work unless a user opts in.

```toml
[analytics]
enabled = true

[feedback]
enabled = true

[log_db]
enabled = true

[runtime_optimizations]
rollout_batch_flush = true
app_server_notification_coalescing = true
```

`analytics.enabled` controls product usage analytics. `feedback.enabled`
controls feedback upload and the in-memory feedback tracing layers. `log_db`
controls the local SQLite log layer used for diagnostics.

`runtime_optimizations.rollout_batch_flush` skips rollout JSONL per-line flushes
and keeps batch-barrier flushes such as turn/persist/shutdown boundaries. This
reduces disk I/O, but an extreme process crash can lose the last few not-yet
flushed history records.

`runtime_optimizations.app_server_notification_coalescing` batches high-frequency
app-server notifications for a short window, currently command output deltas,
file-change deltas, token usage updates, diff updates, and plan updates. Users
may see output arrive in small chunks instead of one tiny update at a time.

## Custom CA Certificates

Codex can trust a custom root CA bundle for outbound HTTPS and secure websocket
connections when enterprise proxies or gateways intercept TLS. This applies to
login flows and to Codex's other external connections, including Codex
components that build reqwest clients or secure websocket clients through the
shared `codex-client` CA-loading path and remote MCP connections that use it.

Set `CODEX_CA_CERTIFICATE` to the path of a PEM file containing one or more
certificate blocks to use a Codex-specific CA bundle. If
`CODEX_CA_CERTIFICATE` is unset, Codex falls back to `SSL_CERT_FILE`. If
neither variable is set, Codex uses the system root certificates.

`CODEX_CA_CERTIFICATE` takes precedence over `SSL_CERT_FILE`. Empty values are
treated as unset.

The PEM file may contain multiple certificates. Codex also tolerates OpenSSL
`TRUSTED CERTIFICATE` labels and ignores well-formed `X509 CRL` sections in the
same bundle. If the file is empty, unreadable, or malformed, the affected Codex
HTTP or secure websocket connection reports a user-facing error that points
back to these environment variables.

## Notices

Codex stores "do not show again" flags for some UI prompts under the `[notice]` table.

## Plan mode defaults

`plan_mode_reasoning_effort` lets you set a Plan-mode-specific default reasoning
effort override. When unset, Plan mode uses the built-in Plan preset default
(currently `medium`). When explicitly set (including `none`), it overrides the
Plan preset. The string value `none` means "no reasoning" (an explicit Plan
override), not "inherit the global default". There is currently no separate
config value for "follow the global default in Plan mode".

## Realtime start instructions

`experimental_realtime_start_instructions` lets you replace the built-in
developer message Codex inserts when realtime becomes active. It only affects
the realtime start message in prompt history and does not change websocket
backend prompt settings or the realtime end/inactive message.
